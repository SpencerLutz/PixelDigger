A "game" about digging and building in a two dimensional world

Left click to dig away tiles and reveal caves underground, with numerous different minerals to find. Then, right click in an empty tile to build with those materials. Scroll to change which material you're using; the material color will be displayed in the top left corner. (My UI skills were poor in 2017.)

I also learned to read from and write to files with this project. Click one of the three blue tiles in the top left to save the current map, and click its respective red tile in the top right anytime to load it back in. Lastly, the green tile in the top right generates a new map.

There's also a tile that, when clicked, will reveal the entire map, but that's a secret :)

P.S. I find it really satisfying how the light floods into the caves. This wasn't intended but I haven't removed it for this reason.
